[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fwildangunawan%2Fheadquarter&project-name=hq-frontend&root-directory=kingbob)

Demo of `kingbob` can be viewed [here](https://headquarter.vercel.app).

### Getting Started

#### 1. Installing packages

To start developing `kingbob`, you have to clone the project and run some command to get NPM packages.

After cloning the project, open `kingbob` folder in your terminal and run:

```bash
yarn
```

If there is no error message popped up, you should be good to go to next step.

Note: We recommend using yarn instead of npm since it's a lot better than npm. You're free to choose whether you like to use yarn or npm though.

#### 2. Let's go

After all package installed, you can start running the frontend in your local dev environtment.

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You then can start editing the project. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
